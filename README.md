# FUSS: Faokryn's Universal Styling System

A front-end framework and component library for use across my web projects.

## Background

While developing web projects, I found that I wanted a solution to quickly add styles and components to my web pages, but I wanted this style to be unique and reflect my personal design preferences.

At the same time, I wanted to get a better understanding of how popular front-end frameworks and component libraries work "under the hood" and why they make the design decisions that they do, to gain a better understanding of web development best practices.

Thus, I began developing my own universal front-end framework and component library for use across my projects. This system is meant to reflect my personal needs and design preferences while being informed by modern design and popular front-end frameworks and component libraries, such as [Bootstrap][1] and [jQueryUI][2].

## Demo

A side-by-side comparison with [Bootstrap 3][2] is viewable [here][4].
